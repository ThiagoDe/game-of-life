Game of Life in React
Welcome to the Game of Life implementation in React! 

Introduction
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's played on a grid of cells, each of which can be either alive or dead. The game progresses through generations, with cells changing state according to specific rules.

To learn more about Conway's Game of Life, visit Wikipedia.

Requirements
The basic functionalities required for this implementation are:

Playable grid: Users can toggle cells between alive and dead using the mouse.
Automatic progression: The game progresses through generations automatically based on the Game of Life rules.
Pause/play button: Allows users to pause and resume the game.
Reset button: Resets the grid to its initial state.

Additional Features
Random grid generation: create a grid of cells with random states.
Customize Grid Size: By default, the grid comprises 20 rows and 45 columns. However, you have the flexibility to tailor it to your needs, adjusting the dimensions from as small as 4 to as expansive as 150 rows and columns.
